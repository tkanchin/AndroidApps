#Android Mobile Applications
The repository contains many variants of android mobile applications which were natively developed using Android Studio.

* Some apps provide examples on the usage of basic UI elements such as Butttons, EditTexts, Radio Buttons, Checkboxes, etc..
* Some apps provides examples on ListViews, AdapterViews, Activities and even Fragments.
* Few cross platform apps built using FrameWork7 https://framework7.io/

##Things To Remember

###FireBase Backend
Some of the mobile applications uses Firebase https://firebase.google.com/ for storing and retrieval of data. Please clone the project and
change the code if you plan to use Firebase or any other custom made web-server. Please raise an issue if you need help on how to do this.

###API's
I have used many open source and trial period APIs to create these mobile applications. Please use your own APIs to avoid unncessary app crashes.

Happy Coding!! :smile:
