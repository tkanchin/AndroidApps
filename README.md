#Android Mobile Applications
The repository contains many variants of android mobile applications which were natively developed using Android Studio.
1. Some apps provide examples on the usage of basic UI elements such as Butttons, EditTexts, Radio Buttons, Checkboxes, etc..
2. Some apps provides examples on ListViews, AdapterViews, Activities and even Fragments.
3. Few cross platform apps built using FrameWork7 https://framework7.io/

##Things to remember:

###FireBase backend
Some of the mobile applications uses Firebase https://firebase.google.com/ for storing and retrieval of data. Please clone the project and
change the code if you plan to use Firebase or any other custom made web-server. Please raise an issue if you need help on how to do this.

###APIs
I have used many open source and trial period APIs to create these mobile applications. Please use your own APIs to avoid unncessary app crashes.

Happy Coding!! :smile:
